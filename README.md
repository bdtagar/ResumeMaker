# ResumeMaker
I have developed this application for any company to use that allows customers create and manage 

their resumes online securely. I have developed in ASP.NET 4 WebForms. I have used LocalDb as a 

database so that application itself has db inbuilt. 

Under Construction: 
I am still working on it. I am publishing it along with code. Try it, expand it and redistribute it.


License: 
I allow you to use this application and share it with friends. But it is as is. I don't take 

ownership of any loss due to it. Sorry for that. But this is a good application. Trust me.
